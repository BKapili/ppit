Phylogenetic Placement for Inferring Taxonomy (PPIT) is an R package for inferring microbial taxonomy from _nifH_ amplicons. PPIT provides a higher proportion of correct taxonomic inferences at all taxonomic ranks in comparison to BLAST-based approaches at the cost of fewer total inferences.

## Installation

To install `ppit` directly from RStudio, use the `devtools` package:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BKapili/ppit")
```

## Documentation

To get started, see the [tutorial](https://github.com/BKapili/ppit/blob/master/tutorial/ppit_tutorial.md) that walks through the analysis using _nifH_ amplicons generated from Illumina MiSeq data.
